        other existing statements. In other words, the more general versions of
        a given statement do not appear at the top level, but instead are
        listed in the `supports` field of the top-level statements.

        If :py:attr:`unique_stmts` has not been initialized with the
        de-duplicated statements, :py:meth:`combine_duplicates` is called
        internally.

        After this function is called the attribute :py:attr:`related_stmts` is
        set as a side-effect.

        The procedure for combining statements in this way involves a series
        of steps:

        1. The statements are grouped by type (e.g., Phosphorylation) and
           each type is iterated over independently.
        2. Statements of the same type are then grouped according to their
           Agents' entity hierarchy component identifiers. For instance,
           ERK, MAPK1 and MAPK3 are all in the same connected component in the
           entity hierarchy and therefore all Statements of the same type
           referencing these entities will be grouped. This grouping assures
           that relations are only possible within Statement groups and
           not among groups. For two Statements to be in the same group at
           this step, the Statements must be the same type and the Agents at
           each position in the Agent lists must either be in the same
           hierarchy component, or if they are not in the hierarchy, must have
           identical entity_matches_keys. Statements with None in one of the
           Agent list positions are collected separately at this stage.
        3. Statements with None at either the first or second position are
           iterated over. For a statement with a None as the first Agent,
           the second Agent is examined; then the Statement with None is
           added to all Statement groups with a corresponding component or
           entity_matches_key in the second position. The same procedure is
           performed for Statements with None at the second Agent position.
        4. The statements within each group are then compared; if one
           statement represents a refinement of the other (as defined by the
           `refinement_of()` method implemented for the Statement), then the
           more refined statement is added to the `supports` field of the more
           general statement, and the more general statement is added to the
           `supported_by` field of the more refined statement.
        5. A new flat list of statements is created that contains only those
           statements that have no `supports` entries (statements containing
           such entries are not eliminated, because they will be retrievable
           from the `supported_by` fields of other statements). This list
           is returned to the caller.

        On multi-core machines, the algorithm can be parallelized by setting
        the poolsize argument to the desired number of worker processes.
        This feature is only available in Python > 3.4.

        .. note:: Subfamily relationships must be consistent across arguments

            For now, we require that merges can only occur if the *isa*
            relationships are all in the *same direction for all the agents* in
            a Statement. For example, the two statement groups: `RAF_family ->
            MEK1` and `BRAF -> MEK_family` would not be merged, since BRAF
            *isa* RAF_family, but MEK_family is not a MEK1. In the future this
            restriction could be revisited.

        Parameters
        ----------
        return_toplevel : Optional[bool]
            If True only the top level statements are returned.
            If False, all statements are returned. Default: True
        poolsize : Optional[int]
            The number of worker processes to use to parallelize the
            comparisons performed by the function. If None (default), no
            parallelization is performed. NOTE: Parallelization is only
            available on Python 3.4 and above.
        size_cutoff : Optional[int]
            Groups with size_cutoff or more statements are sent to worker
            processes, while smaller groups are compared in the parent process.
            Default value is 100. Not relevant when parallelization is not
            used.

        Returns
        -------
        list of :py:class:`indra.statement.Statement`
            The returned list contains Statements representing the more
            concrete/refined versions of the Statements involving particular
            entities. The attribute :py:attr:`related_stmts` is also set to
            this list. However, if return_toplevel is False then all
            statements are returned, irrespective of level of specificity.
            In this case the relationships between statements can
            be accessed via the supports/supported_by attributes.

        Examples
        --------

        site is identified as supporting a more specific statement:
