class CFPG(PathsGraph):
    """Representation of cycle-free paths in a graph of a given length.

    We construct a representation of cycle_free paths of a fixed length. This
    fixed length will often not be mentioned in what follows.  We call our
    representation "the cycle_free paths graph". Below it is the graph G_cf
    (actually it is G_cf_pruned but for now it will be convenient to ignore
    this distinction).

    G_cf is required to have three properties.

    * CF1: Every source-to-target path in G_cf is cycle free.
    * CF2: Every cycle free path in the original graph appears as a
      source-to-target path in G_cf.
    * CF3: There is a 1-1 correspondence between the paths in G_cf and the
      paths in the original graph. This means there is no redundancy in the
      representation.  For every path in the original graph there is a unique
      path in G_cf that corresponds to it.

    These 3 conditions will ensure that we can sample paths in the original
    graph faithfully by sampling paths in G_cf. We can also perform graph
    theoretic operations on G_cf to simulate useful operations on the set of
    paths in the original graph.

    The starting point is the paths graph (pg_raw below) that represents "all"
    paths (cycle free or not) of the given fixed length from source to target.

    Then using an initial iterative procedure we prune away junk nodes (that
    cannot appear on any cycle free path from source to target) and more
    importantly tag each node with its cycle free history. More precisely if u
    is in tags[v] then we are guaranteed that every path from u to v that
    involves only nodes appearing in tags[v] will be v-cycle_free. In other
    words the name of v (i.e.  v[1]) will not appear in the path. Further, it
    will also be u-cycle free.  Note however tags[u] may contain a node that
    has the same name as that of v.  Indeed this the crux of the problem.

    Moving on, this tagged path graph is named G_0 and the associated tags map
    is named T_0 below.

    G_cf is computed by refining G_0. But first let us consider why G_0 is not
    an ideal representation of the set of cycle free paths of a fixed length.
    First, G_0 does not have the property (CF1) (though it does have the
    properties (CF2) and (CF3)). As a result one can't just walk through the
    graph from source to node and generate a cycle free path. Instead one must
    use a sampling method with memory to generate cycle free paths. In
    particular if one has reached the node u via the path p and v is a
    successors of u then one can extend p by moving to v only if p is contained
    in T_0[v]. Thus whether the move along the edge (u,v) is conditioned by the
    memory of how u was reached. Further, one can get stuck while using this
    sampling procedure. Hence it is not clear whether one is sampling the set
    of paths of interest in a faithful fashion. More importantly it is not
    clear how one can perform graph theoretic operations on G_0 to simulate
    operations on the set of cycle fre paths of interest. We will however keep
    in mind that G_0 together with its path sampling procedure is  a useful
    tool to have around.

    Constructing G_cf by refining G_0 may be viewed as synthesizing a
    memoryless strategy for generating cycle free paths. In other words, if
    (u,v) is an edge in G_cf then no matter how we have reached u we must be
    able to transition to v. A necessary condition that will enable this is to
    ensure that the set of tags of u (T_cf[u]) is included in the set of tags
    of v (T_cf[v]) in G_cf. The challenge is to achieve this while ensuring
    that the properies (CF1), (CF2) and (CF3) are met.

        will be a quadruple of the form (V_i, next_i, pred_i, t_i).

        V_i will be the set of nodes at level i.

        A node--after dic_CF[i] has been computed--will be of the form (i, n, c)
        where i is the level, n is the name and c is the copy number of the node
        (i,n) in G_0. In other words, each node in G_0 will be split into one or
        more copies to implement our memoryless sampling strategy.

        next_i is the successor relation for the CFPG.

        pred_i[v] is the set of predecessors of v in V_i. The construction
        proceeds from the target to source. At stage i of the construction we
        convert nodes of the form (i, n) into nodes of the form (i,n,c). For
        any such new node pred_i[v] will be nodes of the form (i-1,n) at level
