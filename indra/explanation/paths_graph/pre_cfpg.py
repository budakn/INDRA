class PreCFPG(PathsGraph):
    """Representation of a pre- cycle free paths graph with associated methods.

    The pre- cycle free paths graph consists of the paths graph remaining after
    cycles through the source or target nodes are removed. However, paths
    through the pre-CFPG node structure itself are not guaranteed to be cycle
    free; instead, cycle-free paths can be sampled by taking into account
    the tags associated with each node, representing the possible cycle-free
    histories of the node in terms of other upstream nodes.

    As with the "raw" paths graph (containing cycles), nodes in the pre-CFPG
    consist of tuples with two elements: (depth, name).

    Starting from the "raw" (i.e., containing cycles) paths graph, and
    given a target path length n, the algorithm iterates over each "level"
    in the graph 0 <= k <= n where level 0 consists only of the source node
    and level n consists only of the target.

    Each level k consists of a set of nodes, X; we examine each node x in X
    and identify the subset of nodes that are reachable in both the forward
    and backward directions from x. If any of the nodes in the forward
    reach subgraph contain x itself (but at a different depth), this
    represents a cyclic path back through x that is then pruned.

    Each node x therefore defines its own subgraph of cycle free paths,
    g_x.  After iterating over all x in X, we combine these subgraphs into
    the (in-progress) cycle free paths graph H_k. H_k therefore consists of
    the superset of nodes of all the subgraphs g_x for level k. When
    merging these subgraphs we prevent the re-introduction of cyclic paths
    by annotating each node in the graph with a list of "tags". The tags
    for any given node consist of a list of nodes lying at prior (upstream)
    levels. Therefore during sampling, transitions from an upstream node to
    a downstream node are only permissible if all nodes in the path up to a
    certain level are contained in the tag set of the downstream node.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pg : PathsGraph
        "Raw" (contains cycles) paths graph as created by

    tags : dict
        A dictionary, keyed by node, with lists of other nodes representing
        the nodes lying upstream on cycle free paths. Node that each node
        also has itself as a tag.

    ----------
    source_node : tuple
        Node in the pre-CFPG graph representing the source: (0, source_name)

        target_polarity : 0 or 1
