    """Build a tree representing a set of paths.

    Nodes in the tree are tuples representing the common prefix of all
    downstream paths. The head of the tree is an empty tuple, `()`. Each leaf
    of the tree represents a complete path.

    Parameters
    ----------
    paths : iterable of tuples
        Each element of the iterable is a tuple representing a sequence of
        nodes that constitutes a path.
    source_graph : networkx.DiGraph (optional)
        Source graph used to generate the set of paths and containing edge
        weights keyed by 'weight' in the edge metadata. If provided, allows
        weighted sampling over paths in the PathsTree. If not provided, all
        edges are considered to have locally equal weights of 1.

    Attributes
    ----------
    graph : networkx.DiGraph
        A directed graph representing the set of paths as a tree.
