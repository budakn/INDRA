    Parameters
    ----------
    g : nx.DiGraph
        The underlying graph used for computing reachable node sets.

        Name of source node.

        to the target, so that any path found from the source to the target
        will have the overall polarity as specified by the target_polarity
        argument.

        The function uses the forward and backward reach sets provided as
        arguments to efficiently identify the subset of nodes that are
        reachable from both the forward and backward directions. Pairs of nodes
        at neighboring levels are then checked against the original graph to
        determine which nodes are connected by edges with the appropriate
        direction and polarity. These nodes are then used to create a new
        graph, the "paths graph," which consists solely of these nodes and
        edges. This graph represents the superset of all possible paths from
        source to target of a given legnth and target polarity. Specific paths
        can then be obtained by sampling.

        target_polarity : int
            Whether the desired path from source to target is positive (0)
            or negative (1).
        length : int
            Length of paths to compute.
        fwd_reachset : Optional[dict]
            Dictionary of sets representing the forward reachset computed over
            the original graph g up to a maximum depth greater than the
            requested path length.  If not provided, the forward reach set is
            calculated up to the requested path length up to the requested path
            length by calling paths_graph.get_reachable_sets.
        back_reachset : Optional[dict]
            Dictionary of sets representing the backward reachset computed over
            the original graph g up to a maximum depth greater than the
            requested path length.  If not provided, the backward reach set is
            calculated up to the requested path length up to the requested path
            length by calling paths_graph.get_reachable_sets.
        signed : bool
            Specifies whether the underlying graph and the corresponding
            f_level and b_level reachable sets have signed edges.  If True,
            sign information should be encoded in the 'sign' field of the edge
            data, with 0 indicating a positive edge and 1 indicating a negative
            edge.
        target_polarity : 0 or 1
            Specifies the polarity of the target node: 0 indicates
            positive/activation, 1 indicates negative/inhibition.
